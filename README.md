This library is a simple HTTP client library that enables establishing connections, sending GET requests and POST requests and a command line implementation that enables the user to:

1.Use the verbosity option to have detailed information on response
2. Send as many headers along with the request
3. Add inline data to the request
4. Read a text file to send the content as inline data
5. Redirect the request to another page if the original page makes a response with a status code of 3xx version
6. Write the body of the response on a new text file.
